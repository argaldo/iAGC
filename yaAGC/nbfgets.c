  Filename:	nbfgets.c
  Purpose:	A portable (i.e., Linux AND Win32) non-blocking variant of fgets. 
  		Requires pthreads (on *nix) or "POSIX Threads for Win32"
		(http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/).
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.
  Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
  Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
  Mods:		08/09/04 RSB.	Began.
		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
		07/13/05 RSB	Fixed the of using too much CPU time in Win32.
		07/30/05 JMS    Added use of GNU libreadline to read in the
		                debug command, and source file name completion.
		08/13/05 RSB	Added an initializer for nbfgetsCond, on the
				advice of "grosman".
		06/13/08 OH	Intercept rl_getc_function to ignore LF
		04/24/09 RSB	Added some conditioning for some readline stuff.
		08/01/09 RSB	I believe that the return value of readline()
				was being treated incorrectly, in that EOF was
				being checked for in the returned string when
				actually the returned string would be NULL, 
				thus causing a segfault.  Also, added WIN32-only
				checking for goofiness in the return values of
				readline() and rl_getc().
		08/02/09 RSB	Tried to make it work again without readline
				support.

 * always 8-bit characters.  so we need to catch illegal characters
