  Filename:	agc_engine.c
  Purpose:	This is the main engine for binary simulation of the Apollo AGC
  		computer.  It is separate from the Display/Keyboard (DSKY) 
		simulation and Apollo hardware simulation, though compatible
		with them.  The executable binary may be created using the
		yayul (Yet Another YUL) assembler.
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.

  Mods:		04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
  		08/20/03 RSB.	Now bitmasks are handled on input channels.
		11/26/03 RSB.	Up to now, a pseudo-linear space was used to
				model internal AGC memory.  This was simply too
				tricky to work with, because it was too hard to
				understand the address conversions that were
				taking place.  I now use a banked model much
				closer to the true AGC memory map.
		11/28/03 RSB.	Added code for a bunch of instruction types,
				and fixed a bunch of bugs.
		11/29/03 RSB.	Finished out all of the instruction types.
				Still a lot of uncertainty if Overflow
				and/or editing has been handled properly.
				Undoubtedly many bugs.
		05/01/04 RSB	Now makes sure that in --debug-dsky mode
				doesn't execute any AGC code (since there
				isn't any loaded anyhow).
		05/03/04 RSB	Added a workaround for "TC Q".  It's not 
				right, but it has to be more right than
				what was there before.
		05/04/04 RSB	Fixed a bug in CS, where the unused bit
				could get set and thereforem mess up 
				later comparisons.  Fixed an addressing bug
				(was 10-bit but should have been 12-bit) in
				the AD instruction.  DCA was completely 
				messed up (still don't know about overflow).
		05/05/04 RSB	INDEX'ing was messed up because the pending
				index was zeroed before being completely 
				used up.  Fixed the "CCS A" instruction.
				Fixed CCS in the case of negative compare-
				values.
		05/06/04 RSB	Added rfopen.  The operation of "DXCH L"
				(which is ambiguous in the docs but actually 
				used --- at Luminary131 address 33,03514) --- 
				has been redefined in accordance with the 
				Luminary program's comments.  Adjusted 
				"CS A" and "CA A", though I don't actually
				think they work differently.  Fixed a 
				potential divide-by-0 in DV.
		05/10/04 RSB	Fixed up i/o channel operations so that they
				properly use AGC-formatted integers rather
				than the simulator's native-format integers.
		05/12/04 RSB	Added the data collection for backtraces.
		05/13/04 RSB	Corrected calculation of the superbank address.
		05/14/04 RSB	Added interrupt service and hopefully fixed the
				RESUME instruction.  Fixed a bunch of instructions
				(but not all, since I couldn't figure out how to
				consistently do it) that modify the Z register.
		05/15/04 RSB	Repaired the interrupt vector and the RESUME
				instruction, so that they do not automatically
				save/restore A, L, Q, and BB to/from
				ARUPUT, LRUPT, QRUPT, and BBRUPT.  The ISR
				is supposed to do that itself, if it wants
				it done. And (sigh!) the RESUME instruction
				wasn't working, but was treated as INDEX 017.
		05/17/04 RSB	Added MasterInterruptEnable.  Added updates of
				timer-registers TIME1 and TIME2, of TIME3 and
				TIME4, and of SCALER1 and SCALER2.
		05/18/04 RSB	The mask used for writing to channel 7 have
				changed from 0100 to 0160, because the
				Luminary131 source (p.59) claims that bits
				5-7 are used.  I don't know what bits 5-6
				are for, though.
		05/19/04 RSB	I'm beginning to grasp now what to do for 
				overflow.  The AD instruction (in which
				overflow was messed up) and the TS instruction
				(which was completely bollixed) have hopefully
				been fixed now.
		05/30/04 RSB	Now have a spec to work from (my assembly-
				language manual).  Working to bring this code
				up to v0.50 of the spec.
		05/31/04 RSB	The instruction set has basically been completely
				rewritten.
		06/01/04 RSB	Corrected the indexing of instructions 
				for negative indices.  Oops!  The instruction
				executed on RESUME was taken from BBRUPT
				instead of BRUPT.
		06/02/04 RSB	Found that I was using an unsigned datatype
				for EB, FB, and BB, thus causing comparisons of
				them to registers to fail.  Now autozero the 
				unused bits of EB, FB, and BB.
		06/04/04 RSB	Separated ServerStuff function from agc_engine
				function.
		06/05/04 RSB	Fixed the TCAA, ZQ, and ZL instructions.
		06/11/04 RSB	Added a definition for uint16_t in Win32.
		06/30/04 RSB	Made SignExtend, AddSP16, and
				OverflowCorrected non-static.
		07/02/04 RSB	Fixed major bug in SU instruction, in which it
				not only used the wrong value, but overwrote
				the wrong location.
		07/04/04 RSB	Fixed bug (I hope) in converting "decent"
				to "DP".  The DAS instruction did not leave the
				proper values in the A,L registers.
		07/05/04 RSB	Changed DXCH to do overflow-correction on the
				accumulator.  Also, the special cases "DXCH A"
				and "DXCH L" were being checked improperly
				before, and therefore were not treated 
				properly.
		07/07/04 RSB	Some cases of DP arithmetic with the MS word
				or LS word being -0 were fixed.
		07/08/04 RSB	CA and CS fixed to re-edit after doing their work.
				Instead of using the overflow-corrected 
				accumulator, BZF and BZMF now use the complete
				accumulator.  Either positive or negative
				overflow blocks BZF, while positive overflow
				blocks BZMF.
		07/09/04 RSB	The DAS instruction has been completely rewritten
				to alter the relative signs of the output.
				Previously they were normalized to be identical,
				and this is wrong.  In the DV instruction, the
				case of remainder==0 needed to be fixed up to
				distinguish between +0 and -0.
		07/10/04 RSB	Completely replaced MSU.  And ... whoops! ...
				forgot to inhibit interrupts while the 
				accumulator contains overflow.  The special 
				cases "DCA L" and "DCS L" have been addressed.
				"CCS A" has been changed similarly to BZF and 
				BZMF w.r.t. overflow.
		07/12/04 RSB	Q is now 16 bits.
		07/15/04 RSB	Pretty massive rewrites:  Data alignment changed 
				to bit 0 rather than 1.  All registers at
				addresses less than REG16 are now 16 bits, 
				rather than just A and Q.
		07/17/04 RSB	The final contents of L with DXCH, DCA, and 
				DCS are now overflow-corrected.
		07/19/04 RSB	Added SocketInterlace/Reload.
		08/12/04 RSB	Now account for output ports that are latched
				externally, and for updating newly-attached
				peripherals with current i/o-port values.
		08/13/04 RSB	The Win32 version of yaAGC now recognizes when
				socket-disconnects have occurred, and allows
				the port to be reused.
		08/18/04 RSB	Split off all socket-related stuff into 
				SocketAPI.c, so that a cleaner API could be
				available for integrators.
		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
		05/15/05 RSB	Oops!  The unprogrammed counter increments were
				hooked up to i/o space rather than to 
				erasable.  So incoming counter commands were
				ignored.
		06/11/05 RSB	Implemented the fictitious output channel 0177
				used to make it easier to implement an
				emulation of the gyros.
		06/12/05 RSB	Fixed the CounterDINC function to emit a
				POUT, MOUT, or ZOUT, as it is supposed to.
		06/16/05 RSB	Implemented IMU CDU drive output pulses.
		06/18/05 RSB	Fixed PINC/MINC at +0 to -1 and -0 to +1
				transitions.
		06/25/05 RSB	Fixed the DOWNRUPT interrupt requests.
		06/30/05 RSB	Hopefully fixed fine-alignment, by making
				the gyro torquing depend on the GYROCTR
				register as well as elapsed time.
		07/01/05 RSB	Replaced the gyro-torquing code, to 
				avoid simulating the timing of the 
				3200 pps. pulses, which was conflicting
				somehow with the timing Luminary wanted
				to impose.
		07/02/05 RSB	OPTXCMD & OPTYCMD.
		07/04/05 RSB	Fix for writes to channel 033.
		08/17/05 RSB	Fixed an embarrassing bug in SpToDecent,
				thanks to Christian Bucher.
		08/20/05 RSB	I no longer allow interrupts when the 
				program counter is in the range 0-060.
				I do this principally to guard against the
				case Z=0,1,2, since I'm not sure that all of
				the AGC code saves registers properly in this
				case.  Now I inhibit interrupts prior to 
				INHINT, RELINT, and EXTEND (as we're supposed
				to), as well as RESUME (as we're not supposed
				to).  The intent of the latter is to take
				care of problems that occur when EDRUPT is used.
				(Specifically, an interrupt can occur between
				RELINT and RESUME after an EDRUPT, and this
				messes up the return address in ZRUPT used by
				the RESUME.)
		08/21/05 RSB	Removed the interrupt inhibition from the 
				address range 0-060, because it prevented
				recovery from certain conditions.
		08/28/05 RSB	Oops!  Had been using PINC sequences on 
				TIME6 rather than DINC sequences.
		10/05/05 RSB	FIFOs were introduced for PCDU or MCDU
				commands on the registers CDUX, CDUY, CDUZ.
				The purpose of these FIFOs is to make sure
				that CDUX, CDUY, CDUZ are updated at no
				more than an 800 cps rate, in order to
				avoid problems with the Kalman filter in the
				DAP, which is otherwise likely to reject
				counts that change too quickly.
		10/07/05 RSB	FIFOs changed from 800 cps to either 400 cps
				("low rate") or 6400 cps ("high rate"), 
				depending on the variable CduHighRate.
				At the moment, CduHighRate is stuck at 0,
				because we've worked out no way to plausibly
				change it.
		11/13/05 RSB	Took care of auto-adjust buffer timing for 
				high-rate and low-rate CDU counter updates.
				PCDU/MCDU commands 1/3 are slow mode, and
				PCDU/MCDU commands 021/023 are fast mode.
		02/26/06 RSB	Oops!  This wouldn't build under Win32 because
				of the lack of an int32_t datatype.  Fixed.
		03/30/09 RSB	Moved Downlink local static variable from 
				CpuWriteIO() to agc_t, trying to overcome the
				lack of resumption of telemetry after an AGC
				resumption in Windows.
  
  The technical documentation for the Apollo Guidance & Navigation (G&N) system,
  or more particularly for the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) may be found at 
  http://hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public.  That is, to the extent that the 
  documentation exists online it may be found there.  I'm sure -- or rather 
  HOPE -- that there's more documentation at NASA and MIT than has been made 
  available yet.  I personally had no knowledge of the AGC, other than what 
  I had seen in the movie "Apollo 13" and the HBO series "From the Earth to 
  the Moon", before I conceived this project last night at midnight and 
  started doing web searches.  So, bear with me; it's a learning experience!
  
  Also at hrst.mit.edu are the actual programs for the Command Module (CM) and 
  Lunar Module (LM) AGCs.  Or rather, what's there are scans of 1700-page 
  printouts of assembly-language listings of SOME versions of those programs.  
  (Respectively, called "Colossus" and "Luminary".)  I'll worry about how to 
  get those into a usable version only after I get the CPU simulator working!
  
  What THIS file contains is basicly a pure simulation of the CPU, without any
  input and output as such.  (I/O, to the DSKY or to CM or LM hardware 
  simulations occurs through the mechanism of sockets, and hence the DSKY 
  front-end and hardware back-end simulations may be implemented as complete 
  stand-alone programs and replaced at will.)  There is a single globally 
  interesting function, called agc_engine, which is intended to be called once 
  per AGC instruction cycle -- i.e., every 11.7 microseconds.  (Yes, that's 
  right, the CPU clock speed was a little over 85 KILOhertz.  That's a factor
  that obviously makes the simulation much easier!)  The function may be called
  more or less often than this, to speed up or slow down the apparent passage 
  of time.

  This function is intended to be completely portable, so that it may be run in 
  a PC environment (Microsoft Windows) or in any *NIX environment, or indeed in
  an embedded target if anybody should wish to create an actual physical 
  replacement for an AGC.  Also, multiple copies of the simulation may be run 
  on the same PC -- for example to simulation a CM and LM simultaneously.

// The case of PCDU or MCDU triggers being applied to the CDUX,Y,Z counters
// presents a special problem.  The AGC expects these triggers to be 
// applied at a certain fixed rate.  The DAP portion of Luminary or Colossus
// applies a digital filter to the counts, in order to eliminate electrical
// noise, as well as noise caused by vibration of the spacecraft.  Therefore,
// if the simulated IMU applies PCDU/MCDU triggers too fast, the digital
// filter in the DAP will simply reject the count, and therefore the spacecraft's
// orientation cannot be measured by the DAP.  Consequently, we have to 
// fake up a kind of FIFO on the triggers to the CDUX,Y,Z counters so that
// we can increment or decrement the counters at no more than the fixed rate.
// (Conversely, of course, the simulated IMU has to be able to supply the 
// triggers *at least* as fast as the fixed rate.)

// per second in "slow mode", and 6400 counts per second in "fast mode".
