  Filename:	agc_engine_init.c
  Purpose:	This is the function which initializes the AGC simulation,
  		from a file representing the binary image of core memory.
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.
  Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
  Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
  Mods:		04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
  		09/07/03 RSB.	Fixed data ordering in the core-rope image
				file (to both endian CPU types to work).
		11/26/03 RSB.	Up to now, a pseudo-linear space was used to
				model internal AGC memory.  This was simply too
				tricky to work with, because it was too hard to
				understand the address conversions that were
				taking place.  I now use a banked model much
				closer to the true AGC memory map.
		11/29/03 RSB.	Added the core-dump save/load.
		05/06/04 RSB	Now use rfopen in looking for the binary.
		07/12/04 RSB	Q is now 16 bits.
		07/15/04 RSB	AGC data now aligned at bit 0 rathern then 1.
		07/17/04 RSB	I/O channels 030-033 now default to 077777
				instead of 00000, since the signals are 
				supposed to be inverted.
		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
	 	07/05/05 RSB	Added AllOrErasable.
		07/07/05 RSB	On a resume, now restores 010 on up (rather
				than 020 on up), on Hugh's advice.
		02/26/06 RSB	Various changes requested by Mark Grant
				to make it easier to integrate with Orbiter.
				The main change is the addition of an
				agc_load_binfile function.  Shouldn't affect
				non-orbiter builds.
		02/28/09 RSB	Fixed some compiler warnings for 64-bit machines.
		03/18/09 RSB	Eliminated periodic messages about 
				core-dump creation when the DebugMode
				flag is set.
		03/27/09 RSB	I've noticed that about half the time, using
				--resume causes the DSKY to become non-responsive.
				I wonder if somehow not all the state variables
				are being saved, and in particular not the 
				state related to interrupt.  (I haven't checked
				this!)  Anyhow, there are extra state variables
				in the agc_t structure which aren't being 
				saved or restored, so I'm adding all of these.
		03/30/09 RSB	Added the Downlink variable to the core dumps.
