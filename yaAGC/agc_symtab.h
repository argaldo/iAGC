// The maximum length of the path for source files and the maximum length of
// a source file name. This perhaps should be MAXPATHLEN (in sys/param.h) but
// I wanted to keep things somewhat platform independent. Also, these are my
// best guesses at reasonable lengths

// upon that Luminary131 has 88 files and Colossus249 has 85. Assuming
// this constant makes the code a bit simpler
